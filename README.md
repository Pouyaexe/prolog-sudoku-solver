# Prolog sudoku solver
This repository contains a Prolog-based Sudoku solver that was created as a project for a AI lab course at my University.

**Purpose:** The program uses the clpfd library and Prolog's built-in constraint satisfaction capabilities to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.

**Usage:** The program is a useful tool for anyone looking to improve their Sudoku solving skills or for researchers studying the application of AI in puzzle solving.
